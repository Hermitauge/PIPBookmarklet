# PIPBookmarklet
A Bookmarklet to enable PIP(Picture-in-Picture) feature on webpage with HTML5 Video content. For macOS Sierra and iPads with PIP support.

This is something I made in a short time, don't expect anything pretty.



### How to Use
[Go to GitHub page for instructions](https://garyworks.github.io/PIPBookmarklet)

### Why bookmarklet instead of extension ###

- Works on iPad too!
- I tried to do it with Safari App Extension, but it seems to require users' actions with the video first. A bookmarklet treated as a users' interactions.
